# 🧪 TDD / BDD Final Project Template

This repository is a template for the **Final Project** of the [Coursera course: Introduction to TDD/BDD](https://www.coursera.org/). It provides the foundational structure to apply both **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** and **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)** in a real-world-style project.

## 🚀 Usage Instructions

This repo is set up as a **template**. To use it:

1. Click the green **"Use this template"** button at the top of this page.
2. Create your own repository from the template.
3. Name your new repo: `tdd-bdd-final-project`
4. Clone your new repo locally and start building!

> ⚠️ Do **not** fork this repo — using the template feature ensures your project stays separate and clean for future Pull Requests and collaboration.

## 🧰 What's Included

- Project folder structure designed for TDD/BDD workflows
- Sample unit and behavior tests (can be customized)
- `README.md` and setup instructions
- Placeholder files for feature specs and scenarios

## 🔧 Technologies & Tools (Suggested)
